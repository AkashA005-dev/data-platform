LAYER 1 — Execution understanding
How to run , print , break , trace

if __name__ == "__main__":
    files = list_raw_files()
    print("Raw files found:", files)


LAYER 2 — Data-flow understanding
In Data Engineering, Python is not “logic heavy”.
It’s flow heavy.

Where does data come from?

What shape is it in?

What changes?

Where does it go?



LAYER 3 — Pattern recognition (this is where mastery grows)

You will see the same patterns again and again:

Read something

Loop over it

Validate

Write output

Log errors







How Python fits your DAILY reality

Weekdays (tired brain)

You:

Modify existing code

Add print statements

Add small validations

Fix one bug

That’s it.


Weekends (fresh brain)

You:

Refactor

Understand “why”

Read documentation

Clean code

This split is intentional.






How I want you to THINK when reading Python

Start asking:

What goes in?

What comes out?

What can break?

How do I detect failure?

That mindset = Data Engineer.
